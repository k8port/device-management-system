SPEC-1: Chore and Reward Management System for Families
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

The Chore and Reward Management System is designed to facilitate household task management and financial education for children. This mobile-centric platform allows parents to assign various tasks, such as household chores, learning activities, and physical exercises, to their children. Upon completion of these tasks, children earn rewards in digital forms such as PayPal deposits, gaming credits, gift certificates, shopping credits, or investments. The platform also provides a wish list feature where children can add items from e-commerce sites, and parents can assign tasks to earn those specific items. This system aims to teach children financial literacy by exposing them to different financial products and goals. The platform targets mobile devices, including phones, tablets, and smartwatches, offering a user-friendly experience tailored for both parents and children with separate login capabilities.

== Requirements

*Must Have:*
- The system should support mobile devices, including phones, tablets, and smartwatches.
- Separate user authentication and login processes for parents and children, with different sets of user activities for each.
- Parents should be able to assign various tasks to children, including household chores, learning activities, and physical exercises.
- Children should earn rewards in various digital forms (e.g., PayPal, gaming credits, gift certificates, shopping credits, and investment accounts).
- A wish list feature where children can add items from e-commerce sites.
- A functionality allowing parents to assign equivalent tasks to earn the items listed in the wish list.
- A cap on monthly spending or rewards set by parents.

*Should Have:*
- Multi-factor authentication for added security.
- Notifications and reminders for tasks and deadlines for children.
- Progress tracking for both tasks and financial goals.

*Could Have:*
- Integration with popular e-commerce sites to facilitate the wish list feature.
- Educational content on financial literacy and goal setting.
- A leaderboard or gamification elements to motivate children.

*Won't Have:*
- Desktop or web platform support initially, focusing solely on mobile platforms.
- Integration with non-digital rewards or physical reward distribution.

2. **Task**: Represents tasks assigned to children, including details such as type, description, reward points, due date, and status.
3. **Reward**: Manages the various types of rewards (digital currency, gift cards, educational rewards) and links them to completed tasks.
4. **Proof**: Stores proof of task completion, such as uploaded images, documents, or test results.
5. **EducationalContent**: Contains information about educational modules or content provided to children, including links, descriptions, and topics.
6. **InteractionLog**: Logs interactions with the ChatGPT service for curiosity exploration, including the content of interactions and timestamps.
7. **DistressSignal**: Captures detected distress signals based on the analysis of user activity or communications, along with severity levels and timestamps.
8. **MindfulnessActivity**: Logs mindfulness activities completed by children, including type, duration, and feedback.

);
```

#### Data Tools and Features

1. **Data Aggregation and Analysis**:
   - **Data Warehouse Integration**: Data from these tables can be regularly synced with a data warehouse like Snowflake or Google BigQuery. This will allow for complex analytics and machine learning tasks, such as understanding user engagement patterns, predicting educational needs, and generating personalized content.
   - **Data Visualization**: Tools like Apache Superset or Tableau can be used to create dashboards for parents and administrators, displaying metrics such as task completion rates, reward distributions, educational progress, and distress signals detected.

2. **Machine Learning and AI Integration**:
   - **Behavioral Insights**: Use machine learning models to analyze data from the `InteractionLog`, `DistressSignal`, and `Task` tables to identify patterns that may indicate areas of interest or concern. 
   - **Personalized Content Recommendation**: Leverage data from the `EducationalContent` and `InteractionLog` tables to recommend personalized content to children, fostering a deeper engagement with topics they show curiosity about.
   - **Distress Detection and Response**: Utilize NLP and sentiment analysis models to continuously analyze interactions and detect potential distress, enabling prompt intervention and support.

3. **Monitoring and Alerts**:
   - **Automated Alerts**: Based on data from the `DistressSignal` table, automated alerts can be sent to parents or guardians when a high-severity signal is detected, along with suggested actions or resources.
   - **Performance Feedback**: Provide regular feedback to children based on their activity data in the `MindfulnessActivity`, `Task`, and `EducationalContent` tables, helping them understand their progress and areas for improvement.
